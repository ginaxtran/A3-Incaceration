# ------- Introduction------

# African Americans have been racially stereotyped for incarceration.
# It has been an agreement to both African Americans and Caucasians, in which African Americans were treated worse than Causcasians.
# In my the charts I have created and varibles I have selected will show how racially disciminated African Americans are, although, they have less incarcerations. 

# ------ 5 variables----

# I chose 5 variables of the year, white_pop15to64, black_pop15to64, state and population.
# 'year' because the year relates the population of that time.
# 'white_pop15to64' because it measures the White population.
# 'black_pop15to64' because it measures the Black population.
# 'state' because it gives a certain area of population.
# 'population' is it provides the total population of both Black and White Americans.

# ------ Time Trend Chart-------

# I included this line chart because it shows a large difference between the white and black population from 2000-2010.
# In this chart the black population is a lot less lower than the white population.
# This shows that the stereotype of black prisoners is racial discrimination because in the chart the black population is very low.

# ------- Variable Comparison Chart------

# I made a scatter plot to show the comparison between African Americans and Caucasian population.
# I have noticed as the African American population gets higher so does the Caucasian population. 
# Also, there are some outliers in the chart when comparing both populations. 

# --------- Map Chart -------

# I have included a map of to show which states had the highest or lowest African American population.
# In this map we can see that Texas, Florida, and Maine had the highest African American Incarceration.
